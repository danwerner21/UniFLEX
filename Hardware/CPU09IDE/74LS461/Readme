You can use a PAL to replace the 74LS461 chip.



But because the Q7 and Q5 outputs are swapped, this is not a direct replacement.
Read the '74LS461 - PAL.pdf'.

Rule 1: If you can get the 74LS461, use it.

Rule 2: If you can possibly get the 74LS461 later, use method 1.

Rule 3: If you are sure you will never use a 74LS461, change the PCB.
