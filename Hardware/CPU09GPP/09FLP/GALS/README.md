Atmel contains the specifications for the Atmel ATF16V8 chips. 
Translated from PALASM to CUPL. 

Check the '09FLP_GAL_Table' to make a selection.

After programming there is a question?
Does the fuse table do what it is programmed to do?
In the TL866II+, import the 09FLP.lgc in the 'Logic IC Test' screen and Test the chip!
Works for GAL...., ATF.... and PALCE... chips.
You can even test with a 5V or 3.3V supply.
